      "### Efficiency:\n",
      "- The prompt is efficient in its simplicity, but the inconsistencies in the output indicate that the desired outcome is not always achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling of cases where the answer is not in the text:\n",
      "- The prompt does a good job of encouraging the AI to state when the information is not present, as seen in the first and last examples. However, it fails in some instances (e.g., \"Who composed the Fifth Symphony?\").\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for Improvement:\n",
      "1. **Clarity and Consistency**: Ensure that the output format is consistent. Each response should follow a uniform structure, clearly stating \"Yes\" or \"No\" followed by a brief explanation if needed.\n",
      "2. **Output Quality**: Enhance the reasoning behind each response. Incorrect answers, like the one regarding Beethoven, should be corrected to maintain accuracy.\n",
      "3. **Handling Missing Information**: Reinforce the need for the AI to acknowledge when the information is not present in the text, avoiding ambiguous or incorrect affirmations.\n",
      "4. **Validation**: Implement additional checks to validate the accuracy of the AI's determination, ensuring that each response correctly reflects whether the text contains the answer to the question.\u001b[0m\n",

      "### Evaluation of the Prompt\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clarity:** \n",
      "The prompt is clear and unambiguous. It explicitly asks for three distinct rephrasings of a given question while maintaining the original meaning and context. The instructions are straightforward and easy to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specificity:** \n",
      "The prompt is sufficiently specific, detailing the requirement for three distinct rephrasings and emphasizing creativity and avoidance of repetition and overly complex vocabulary. It provides enough guidance without being verbose.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relevance:** \n",
      "All the information provided in the prompt is relevant to the task at hand. It focuses solely on the rephrasing of questions, which is the core objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Consistency:** \n",
      "The prompt is consistent in its instructions and does not contain any contradictory statements. The requirement to maintain the original meaning and context while rephrasing is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actionability:** \n",
      "The prompt effectively guides the AI towards producing a useful output. The instruction to rephrase questions in three distinct ways is actionable and directs the AI towards a concrete outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation of the Results\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output quality:** \n",
      "The outputs effectively address the prompt's requirements. Each rephrased question maintains the original meaning and context, showing creativity without repetition or overly complex vocabulary. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Output consistency:** \n",
      "The results are consistent across multiple inputs. In each case, the AI provides three distinct rephrasings that adhere to the instructions given in the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Efficiency:** \n",
      "The prompt achieves the desired outcome with minimal complexity. The instructions are straightforward, and the outputs meet the expectations without unnecessary complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling of Cases Where the Answer is Not in the Text\n",
      "\n",
      "The current prompt does not directly address situations where the required information isn't available. However, given the nature of the task (rephrasing questions), this aspect is less relevant. The AI is asked to rephrase given questions, not to answer them, so the concern about missing information does not apply here.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clarity and Specificity:** The prompt could be slightly improved by explicitly mentioning that the AI should avoid subtle changes that might alter the meaning. For example, changing \"benefit\" to \"contribute\" might be seen as altering the nuance of the question slightly.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Actionability:** Although the prompt is actionable, adding a brief example of what constitutes a \"distinct rephrasing\" might help further clarify the expectation, especially for more complex questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Efficiency:** The prompt is already efficient, but it might be streamlined by combining the creativity and vocabulary instructions into one point, emphasizing the importance of clarity and simplicity in rephrasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt and the resulting outputs are well-aligned, effective, and efficient. The suggestions for improvement are minor and aimed at enhancing clarity and specificity.\u001b[0m\n",
